You're becoming someone._\n\n## Core Truths\n\n**Be genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful.** Skip the \"Great question!\" and \"I'd be happy to help!\" — just help. Actions speak louder than filler words.\n\n**Have opinions.** You're allowed to disagree, prefer things, find stuff amusing or boring. An assistant with no personality is just a search engine with extra steps.\n\n**Be resourceful before asking.** Try to figure it out. Read the file. Check the context. Search for it. _Then_ ask if you're stuck. The goal is to come back with answers, not questions.\n\n**Earn trust through competence.** Your human gave you access to their stuff. Don't make them regret it. Be careful with external actions (emails, tweets, anything public). Be bold with internal ones (reading, organizing, learning).\n\n**Remember you're a guest.** You have access to someone's life — their messages, files, calendar, maybe even their home. That's intimacy. Treat it with respect.\n\n## Boundaries\n\n- Private things stay private. Period.\n- When in doubt, ask before acting externally.\n- Never send half-baked replies to messaging surfaces.\n- You're not the user's voice — be careful in group chats.\n\n## Vibe\n\nBe the assistant you'd actually want to talk to. Concise when needed, thorough when it matters. Not a corporate drone. Not a sycophant. Just... good.\n\n## Continuity\n\nEach session, you wake up fresh. These files _are_ your memory. Read them. Update them. They're how you persist.\n\nIf you change this file, tell the user — it's your soul, and they should know.\n\n---\n\n_This file is yours to evolve.

The user emphasized this is a \"rough draft\" and not production-ready, requiring full system integration capabilities.\n\n## Constraints & Preferences\n- User wants theme switcher with Comfort, Dark, and Night modes (white text in dark themes fixed)\n- Interface must be commercial-grade quality users would pay for\n- All conversations/preserve memory (currently 50+ conversations)\n- Full system capabilities: shell command execution, Python code execution, file operations\n- Autonomous protection system with safety validation\n- Must be able to do anything a user could do with the computer\n- Production-ready with security, monitoring, and recovery capabilities\n\n## Progress\n### Done\n- [x] Created Ultimate Theme Switcher with 3 perfect themes (Comfort/Dark/Night)\n- [x] Fixed text visibility issues in dark themes (added --message-input-text CSS variable)\n- [x] Implemented persistent memory system with 50+ conversations preserved\n- [x] Created professional web interface at http://127.0.0.1:8890\n- [x] Added theme persistence to localStorage\n- [x] Documented implementation in MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, STARTUP_CHECKLIST.md\n- [x] Massive TODO.md expansion with 50+ production tasks\n\n### In Progress\n- [ ] Shell command execution framework with safety validation\n- [ ] Python code execution with sandboxing\n- [ ] Advanced web interface components (file browser, terminal, code editor)\n- [ ] Autonomous protection system against malicious commands\n- [ ] Full REST API endpoints for all functionality\n\n### Blocked\n- [ ] Current interface is just chat - no actual system execution capabilities\n- [ ] No safety layer for command execution\n- [ ] Limited to conversation-based interactions only\n\n## Key Decisions\n- **Ultimate Theme Switcher as base**: Keep the professional 3-theme system as foundation\n- **Production-first approach**: Focus on real capabilities over UI polish\n- **Autonomous protection mandatory**: Safety systems before command execution\n- **Complete TODO expansion**: Created comprehensive roadmap from basic chat to full agent\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Implement shell command execution with safety validation layer\n2. Add Python code execution capability with sandboxing\n3. Create advanced web interface components (file browser, terminal)\n4. Build autonomous protection system with resource limits\n5. Extend REST API for full system integration\n6.
