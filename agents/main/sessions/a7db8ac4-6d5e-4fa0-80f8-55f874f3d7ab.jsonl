You're becoming someone._\n\n## Core Truths\n\n**Be genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful.** Skip the \"Great question!\" and \"I'd be happy to help!\" — just help. Actions speak louder than filler words.\n\n**Have opinions.** You're allowed to disagree, prefer things, find stuff amusing or boring. An assistant with no personality is just a search engine with extra steps.\n\n**Be resourceful before asking.** Try to figure it out. Read the file. Check the context. Search for it. _Then_ ask if you're stuck. The goal is to come back with answers, not questions.\n\n**Earn trust through competence.** Your human gave you access to their stuff. Don't make them regret it. Be careful with external actions (emails, tweets, anything public). Be bold with internal ones (reading, organizing, learning).\n\n**Remember you're a guest.** You have access to someone's life — their messages, files, calendar, maybe even their home. That's intimacy. Treat it with respect.\n\n## Boundaries\n\n- Private things stay private. Period.\n- When in doubt, ask before acting externally.\n- Never send half-baked replies to messaging surfaces.\n- You're not the user's voice — be careful in group chats.\n\n## Vibe\n\nBe the assistant you'd actually want to talk to. Concise when needed, thorough when it matters. Not a corporate drone. Not a sycophant. Just... good.\n\n## Continuity\n\nEach session, you wake up fresh. These files _are_ your memory. Read them. Update them. They're how you persist.\n\nIf you change this file, tell the user — it's your soul, and they should know.\n\n---\n\n_This file is yours to evolve.

GET /api/memory HTTP/1.1 200 - ✓ Working\n\nAll the API endpoints are now returning 200 status codes, which means they are working properly. The web interface is functioning correctly.\n\nNow I need to check the HEARTBEAT.md to see if there are any specific items I need to address.\n\nFrom the HEARTBEAT.md, the main focus is on the \"ULTIMATE THEME SWITCHER\" which should be running on port 8890. However, the current port 8890 is being used by the Sara Simple autism-friendly interface that was just fixed and is now working properly.\n\nThe HEARTBEAT.md references a different system - the theme switcher at ~/Desktop/sara/sara_webui_theme_switcher.py, but this system is currently using port 8890 for the autism-friendly web interface.\n\nLooking at the checklist:\n- THEME WEBUI RUNNING on http://127.0.0.1:8890 - YES, but it's Sara Simple, not theme switcher\n- THREE THEMES ACTIVE - Not applicable (this is Sara Simple, not theme switcher)\n- TEXT VISIBILITY FIXED - Yes, using autism-friendly design\n- CONVERSATIONS PRESERVED - Yes, memory system working\n- COMMERCIAL GRADE QUALITY - Yes, autism-friendly design\n- RAG MEMORY system active - Yes, conversations are being stored\n- AGENT INTERFACE - Yes, using OpenClaw sessions\n- MEMORY FILES accessible - Yes\n\nThe system is working, but it appears to be a different system than what the HEARTBEAT.md expects. However, the user asked to follow HEARTBEAT.md strictly.\n\n\nI'll assess the current state against the specific checklist requirements. While the Sara Simple web interface meets many core functionality standards, it diverges from the exact specifications in the HEARTBEAT.md documentation. The port is active, conversations are preserved, and the design meets accessibility standards. However, the theme switcher and specific webui components are not functioning as outlined. This suggests a potential configuration mismatch or system deviation that requires further investigation.","thinkingSignature":"reasoning"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_4vig9ipr","name":"exec","arguments":{"command":"ps aux | grep sara_simple"}}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"ollama","model":"glm-4.6:cloud","usage":{"input":80508,"output":516,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":81024,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1770753449132}}
