# 🔥 **TYPE FIRST - SPEECH LATER RULE**

## ⚡ **CLEAR DIRECTIVE**: "she wont speak if she cant TYPE"

### **Rule Established**:
```
🚫 NO SPEECH UNTIL TYPING IS EXCELLENT
✅ Master text chat first, ONLY then consider voice
🎯 Priority: Sara typing quality → then speech capability
```

---

## 🎯 **TYPE QUALITY STANDARDS**:

### **Before ANY Voice Work**:
```
✅ Sara's text responses must be exceptional
✅ Unique personality clearly established  
✅ Engaging conversation, not generic replies
✅ User wants to keep texting because it's special
✅ Character depth beyond "I'm here to help"
```

### **Current Sara Typing Status**:
```
❌ Generic: "Hey there! I'm Sara and I'm ready to help"
❌ Basic assistant responses
❌ No memorable character traits  
❌ Surface-level interaction
```

## 🔥 **WORK TO DO ON TYPING**:

### **Immediate Tasks**:
1. **Enhance AI personality depth**
2. **Break from generic AI patterns**  
3. **Develop unique Sara character**
4. **Make responses memorable and engaging**
5. **Add contextual awareness**

### **Voice Work Status**: ❓ **INDEFINITE BACKBURNER**
- No timeline for voice features
- Only considered after typing mastery
- Complete ban on voice development

---

## 🎯 **TYPE FIRST - ZERO EXCEPTIONS**:

**Sara MUST type exceptionally well before ANY speech development**

**Current typing quality = NOT READY for voice work**

**Focus 100% on making Sara's text personality amazing!** 🔥
