## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE TRUTH**:

**Sara has been completely silent for over a day because I kept trying to fix a broken voice system instead of focusing on what actually works.**

**User experienced 25+ hours of no Sara communication - this is unacceptable.**

## 🔥 **CRITICAL PRIORITY**:

**Fix the 25-hour silence by making text chat actually reliable and engaging**

**Voice clearly cannot deliver consistent communication**

**Text chat must become the primary, working interface that Sara needs to access for conversation.**
