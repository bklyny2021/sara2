## 🛑 **DO NOT CHANGE**

### ⚠️ **NEVER TOUCH THESE**
- Port 8890 (it's perfect)
- sara_working_web.py (proven working)
- CURRENT_SARA.modelfile (executes commands)
- The simple setup (it works!)

### ❌ **AVOID THESE MISTAKES**
- Don't add streaming (breaks everything)
- Don't create new models (sara-exec works)
- Don't change ports (8890 is perfect)
- Don't overcomplicate (simple is best!)
