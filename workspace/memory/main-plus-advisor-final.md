       [Basic LOCAL analysis completed]
       [Consulting Kimi K2: "Deep technical analysis of TSLA current momentum"]
       
       KIMI K2 (via Sara): TSLA showing breakdown pattern with support at $395
                          Volume confirms distribution, RSI bearish divergence

SARA: Combining my analysis with Kimi's expertise:
       - TSLA broke below key $420 support
       - Volume confirms selling pressure  
       - Risk-reward favors holding current position
       Recommendation: Avoid TSLA for now, focus on stronger sectors

        if pattern_pattern.repeated:
            self.local_capability[pattern_pattern] = kimi_response
        return self.integrate_with_safety(kimi_response)
