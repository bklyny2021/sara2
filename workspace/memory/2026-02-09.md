## Audio System Resolution (12:14-12:20 EST)

### Problem
- AD106M speaker setup with aux 0 and aux 1 for left/right channels configured
- Audio not playing through speakers, no sound from system
- User reported "i cant hear you either" and requested sound card troubleshooting

### Investigation
- Found multiple audio devices: HDMI outputs (card 0), HD-Audio Generic (card 1), and K66 USB Audio (card 2)
- Default sink was incorrectly set to HDMI output instead of K66 USB speakers
- K66 USB Audio device detected correctly with stereo configuration

### Solution Applied
- Changed default sink to: `alsa_output.usb-K66_K66_20190805V001-00.analog-stereo`
- Verified PCM volume levels at 100% and unmuted on K66 device
- Confirmed stereo channels (front-left, front-right) properly mapped
- Test audio played successfully via paplay

### Status - ISSUE PERSISTING
❌ **PARTIAL RESOLUTION**: System audio works (YouTube plays fine)
❌ **TTS NOT WORKING**: User cannot hear AI voice output specifically
❌ **AUDIO PATH ISSUE**: TTS playback failing despite system audio functional

### Root Cause Analysis
- Speaker system functional (YouTube confirms)
- Default audio sink correctly set to K66 USB speakers
- Issue isolated to AI TTS playback method
- paplay command executes silently (may not actually playing)
