### **Project Planning Complete**
- 📋 **Complete todo list**: 35+ tasks organized by phase
- 🎯 **6-week timeline**: Structured implementation plan  
- 🔍 **Research focus**: Hardware → Model → Integration → Security
- 🚀 **No-rush approach**: Thorough discovery before building

## 📊 IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### **Phase 1: Environment Assessment (This Week)**
- Document your hardware specifications
- Research best local LLM models for your setup
- Test current infrastructure capabilities
- Evaluate phone integration preferences

### **Phase 2: Technology Selection (Next Week)**
- Choose optimal model based on hardware
- Select serving framework (Ollama/llama.cpp)
- Decide phone bridge method
- Design security architecture

### **Phase 3: Prototype Development (Weeks 3-4)**
- Build local model serving
- Create phone chat bridge
- Test end-to-end functionality
- Implement security layer

### **Phase 4: Full Implementation (Weeks 5-6)**
- Complete agent features
- Add monitoring and maintenance
- Optimize performance
- Production deployment

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP

**Hardware Assessment Needed** to guide every subsequent decision:

**What I need to know:**
- CPU型号、核心数和性能
- RAM容量和类型  
- GPU可用性（如果有）
- 存储空间和速度
- 网络配置

**Why this matters first:**
- Determines which local LLM models can run effectively
- Guides model serving framework selection
- Influences phone bridge architecture
- Shapes overall system design

## 🏆 SUCCESS TARGETS DEFINED

✅ **Complete Independence**: No API keys, no external dependencies  
✅ **Privacy Guaranteed**: Everything stays on your local network  
✅ **Phone Integration**: Seamless chat from your phone  
✅ **Quality Experience**: Comparable to current API-based performance  
✅ **Fast Response**: Sub-5 second reply times for phone chat
