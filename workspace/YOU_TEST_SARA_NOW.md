## 🎤 **TEST IT YOURSELF - STEP BY STEP**:

### **STEP 1**: Go to your computer with K66 microphone
### **STEP 2**: Say clearly and moderately: **"Sara"**
### **STEP 3**: Listen for response through AD106M speakers

---

## 📡 **I'M WATCHING THE LOGS RIGHT NOW**:

**When you say "Sara", I should see**:
```
🎤 Wake word detected: Sara
🔊 Spoke: [Sara's response message]
```

**If TTS works**: You'll hear her voice through speakers  
**If TTS fails**: Wake word detected but no audio output

## 🔍 **WE'LL FIND OUT THE TRUTH**:

This is the moment of truth:

### **SCENARIO A - PERFECT OPERATION**:
- Logs show wake word + speech
- You hear Sara's voice through AD106M
- **System is 100% working**

### **SCENARIO B - WAKE WORD WORKING, TTS SILENT**:
- Logs show wake word detected
- No audio output to speakers  
- **This confirms the TTS audio routing issue**

### **SCENARIO C - NOTHING HAPPENS**:
- No wake word detection in logs
- **Hardware/input issue**
