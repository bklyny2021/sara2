## 🔍 **I'M WATCHING THE LOGS RIGHT NOW**:

**The voice agent will log:**
- "🎤 Wake word detected: Sara" (if she hears you)
- "🔊 Spoke: [response message]" (if she responds)
- Error messages (if TTS audio routing fails)

## 🎯 **WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN**:

1. **Say "Sara"** → Logs show wake word detection
2. **Sara responds** → "Yes, I'm listening!"
3. **She speaks** → Audio through AD106M speakers  
4. **Logs confirm** → Both detection and speech logged
