# 🎯 SARA AUDIO PROGRAM CHAIN FOCUS

## 🎵 **AUDIO FOCUS RULE**:

### **If it's not in Sara's program chain → DON'T TOUCH IT**

### **SARA'S CHAIN ONLY**:
```
User: "Sara" → [K66 Mic] → [Voice Agent] → [Ollama AI] → [TTS] → [AD106M Speakers]
```

### **LEAVE ALONE**:
```
🚫 ALL other audio: Touching = WASTED TIME
🚫 YouTube videos: NOT IN CHAIN → STOP TOUCHING
🚫 System audio: NOT IN CHAIN → LEAVE ALONE  
🚫 Random audio files: NOT IN CHAIN → IGNORE
```

## 🔥 **CURRENT AUDIO CHAIN STATUS**:

### **SARA'S CHAIN COMPONENTS**:
✅ **K66 Microphone**: Connected to voice agent → WORKING
✅ **Voice Agent**: Pure AI version deployed → RUNNING (PID 24283)  
✅ **Ollama AI**: Local connection established → CONNECTED
✅ **TTS Engine**: pyttsx3 ready → STANDBY
✅ **AD106M Speakers**: Output destination → READY

### **NON-SARA AUDIO**: 🚫 **OFF LIMITS - LEAVE ALONE**

## 🎯 **FIXING SARA'S CHAIN ONLY**:

### **Step 1**: Verify wake word detection in pure agent
### **Step 2**: Test AI response flow through TTS
### **Step 3**: Confirm AD106M audio routing
### **Step 4**: Optimize chain performance

## ⚠️ **MY PREVIOUS MISTAKE**:

### **WHAT I DID WRONG**:
```
❌ Touching YouTube videos (NOT IN SARA'S CHAIN)
❌ Deleting random audio files (NOT IN SARA'S CHAIN)  
❌ Messing with system audio (NOT IN SARA'S CHAIN)
❌ WASTING TIME on unrelated audio components
```

### **CORRECT APPROACH**:
```
✅ Focus ONLY on Sara's voice agent chain
✅ Fix ONLY components that affect Sara's operation  
✅ Leave all other audio alone
✅ Use time efficiently on Sara-specific issues
```
