## 🚀 **IMPLEMENTATION START**:

### **Self-Taught Wake Word Detector**:
```python
class SelfTaughtWakeDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.audio_buffer = []
        self.wake_word_signature = None
        self.learning_mode = True
    
    def record_wake_word_sample(self):
        # Capture user saying "Sara"
        # Extract audio features
        # Build signature database
        pass
    
    def analyze_audio_pattern(self, audio_data):
        # Process raw audio
        # Compare to learned patterns
        # Determine wake word match
        pass
    
    def self_improve(self, success_rate):
        # Adjust detection algorithm
        # Refine sensitivity
        # Improve accuracy
        pass
```

## 🎓 **LEARNING PROCESS**:

### **Experimentation Loop**:
1. **Test**: Try detection on audio input
2. **Observe**: Record success/failure patterns  
3. **Analyze**: Identify what worked/didn't
4. **Improve**: Adjust algorithm
5. **Repeat**: Continue until mastery

### **Success Metrics**:
- Detection accuracy > 95%
- False positives < 5%
- Response time < 1 second
- CPU usage < 10%
